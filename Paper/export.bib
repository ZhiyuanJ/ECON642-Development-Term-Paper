   abstract = {Background: The tuberculosis targets for the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) call for a 90% reduction in tuberculosis deaths by 2030, compared with 2015, but meeting this target now seems highly improbable. To assess the economic impact of not meeting the target until 2045, we estimated full-income losses in 120 countries, including those due to excess deaths resulting from COVID-19-related disruptions to tuberculosis services, for the period 2020–50. Methods: Annual mortality risk changes at each age in each year from 2020 to 2050 were estimated for 120 countries. This risk change was then converted to full-income risk by calculating a population-level mortality risk change and multiplying it by the value of a statistical life-year in each country and year. As a comparator, we assumed that current rates of tuberculosis continue to decline through the period of analysis. We calculated the full-income losses, and mean life expectancy losses per person, at birth and at age 35 years, under scenarios in which the SDG targets are met in 2030 and in 2045. We defined the cost of inaction as the difference in full-income losses and tuberculosis mortality between these two scenarios. Findings: From 2020 to 2050, based on the current annual decrease in tuberculosis deaths of 2%, 31·8 million tuberculosis deaths (95% uncertainty interval 25·2 million–39·5 million) are estimated to occur, corresponding to an economic loss of US$17·5 trillion (14·9 trillion–20·4 trillion). If the SDG tuberculosis mortality target is met in 2030, 23·8 million tuberculosis deaths (18·9 million–29·5 million) and $13·1 trillion (11·2 trillion–15·3 trillion) in economic losses can be avoided. If the target is met in 2045, 18·1 million tuberculosis deaths (14·3 million–22·4 million) and $10·2 trillion (8·7 trillion–11·8 trillion) can be avoided. The cost of inaction of not meeting the SDG tuberculosis mortality target until 2045 (vs 2030) is, therefore, 5·7 million tuberculosis deaths (5·1 million–8·1 million) and $3·0 trillion (2·5 trillion–3·5 trillion) in economic losses. COVID-19-related disruptions add $290·3 billion (260·2 billion–570·1 billion) to this cost. Interpretation: Failure to achieve the SDG tuberculosis mortality target by 2030 will lead to profound economic and health losses. The effects of delay will be greatest in sub-Saharan Africa. Affected countries, donor nations, and the private sector should redouble efforts to finance tuberculosis programmes and research because the economic dividend of such strategies is likely to be substantial.

It finds that politicians' gender affects policy, but that their social position, i.e., their caste, should be taken into account as well. Female legislators in seats reserved for lower castes and disadvantaged tribes invest more in health and early education and favor "women-friendly" laws, such as amendments to the Hindu Succession Act, which was designed to give women the same inheritance rights as men. They also favor redistributive policies, such as land reforms. In contrast, female legislators from higher castes do not have any impact on "women-friendly" laws, oppose land reforms, invest in higher tiers of education and reduce social expenditure. The causal effect of female legislators is estimated using close elections between women and men. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Since the mid-1990's, one third of Village Council head positions in India have been randomly reserved for a woman: In these councils only women could be elected to the position of head. Village Councils are responsible for the provision of many local public goods in rural areas. Using a dataset we collected on 265 Village Councils in West Bengal and Rajasthan, we compare the type of public goods provided in reserved and unreserved Village Councils. We show that the reservation of a council seat affects the types of public goods provided.

I first examine the effect of gender quotas on the representation of female legislators, study the correlation between gender quotas and different types of government expenditures, and then use quotas as an instrument for the proportion of female legislators to investigate the effect of female legislators on policy outcomes. The results show that an increase in the share of female legislators by one percentage point increases the ratio of government expenditure on health and social welfare to GDP by 0.18 and 0.67 percentage points, respectively. The robustness check supports that the effect of quotas on female legislators is likely to be translated into the influence of female policymakers on social welfare.},

   abstract = {Appendix 1: Explanation of bias when using the missing-indicator method (as supplied by the authors) Suppose one wants to predict blood pressure as a function of age and sex. Further, suppose the covariate age is missing in a number of observations in the study population. When using the indicator method to handle missing covariate data, the missing values are set to 0 (or any other value as long as the same number is used for all missing observations), and a new variable (indicating missingness) is defined and set to 1 if age is missing and 0 otherwise. Then, not only age and sex but also the new variable (the missingness indicator) are included in a multivariable model: Blood pressure = b 0 + b 1 .age + b 2 .sex + b 3 .Indicator For those subjects without missing data, the Indicator is zero and the model fitted to the data is: Blood pressure = b 0 + b 1 .age + b 2 .sex. For those subjects with missing data on the variable age, the Indicator is one and the model fitted to the data is: Blood pressure = b 0 + b 1 .age + b 2 .sex + b 3. Since all missing values on age are set to zero, this model is in fact: Blood pressure = b 0 + b 2 .sex + b 3. Clearly, when estimating the regression coefficient of sex (b 2), the relation between age and sex (i.e., the confounding effect of age on the association between sex and blood pressure) is not taken into account in the latter model. This is no problem if age and sex are not related and missingness of age is not related to the outcome conditional on (or given) sex. Then, the regression coefficient of sex (b 2) is correctly estimated, even though age is not included (adjusted for) in the model. However, when age and sex are related, the estimated regression coefficient of sex (b 2) will be biased, since the relation between sex and age is not adequately taken into account. Formally,},

   abstract = {Comparisons of aggregate health expenditure across different countries have become popular over the last three decades as they permit a systematic investigation of the impact of different institutional regimes and other explanatory variables. Over the years, several regression analyses based on cross-section and panel data have been used to explain the international differences in health expenditure. A common result of these studies is that aggregate income appears to be the most important factor explaining health expenditure variation between countries and that the size of the estimated income elasticity is high and even higher than unity which in that case indicates that health care is a "luxury" good. Additional results indicates, for example, that the use of primary care "gatekeepers" lowers health expenditure and also that the way of remunerating physicians in the ambulatory care sector appears to influence health expenditure; capitation systems tend to lead to lower expenditure than fee-for-service systems. Finally, we also list some issues for the future. We demand more efforts on theory of the macroeconomic analysis of health expenditure, which is underdeveloped at least relative to the macroeconometrics of health expenditure. We also demand more replications based on updated data and methods that seeks to unify the many differing results of previous Studies. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

These considerations raise the question of which characteristics of societies are associated with the quality of life of the people in those societies. Here, we address this issue empirically by statistically analyzing cross-national data. We assess the effects of gender equality in the political sphere, as well as a variety of other factors, on the subjective well-being of nations, as indicated by average self-reported levels of life satisfaction. We find that people report the highest levels of life satisfaction in nations where women have greater political representation, where military spending is low, and where health care spending is high, controlling for a variety of other factors. GDP per capita, urbanization, and natural resource exploitation are not clearly associated with life satisfaction. These findings suggest that nations may be able to improve the subjective quality of life of people without increasing material wealth or natural resource consumption by increasing gender equality in politics and changing public spending priorities. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},
